# Rorschach

The Rorschach test, or inkblot test, is a psychological test in which subjects view inkblots and report their interpretation of what they see. These tests are used by psychologists to evaluate the person's mental state or personality. The test is named after Hermann Rorschach.

In this application, one of the original inkblots are presented to the user for them to fill out and afterwards can compare their answers to other users that have previously answered.
